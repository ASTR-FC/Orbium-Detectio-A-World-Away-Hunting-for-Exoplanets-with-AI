# Orbium-Detectio-A-World-Away-Hunting-for-Exoplanets-with-AI
Project for the NASA Space App Challenge: Automated detection of exoplanets from transit data (Kepler, K2, TESS). This repository contains an AI/ML model for classifying exoplanets and a web interface for interacting with the data. The goal is to make analysis easier for both researchers and beginners.
